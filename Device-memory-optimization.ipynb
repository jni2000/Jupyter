    "Problem Statement\n",
    "James is working on a system that divides applications to a mixed cluster of computing devices. Each application is\n",
    "identified by an integer ID, requires a fixed non-zero amount of memory to execute, and is defined to be either a\n",
    "foreground or background application. IDs are guaranteed to be unique within their own application type, but not\n",
    "across types.\n",
    "Each device should be assigned two applications at once, one foreground application and one background\n",
    "application. Devices have limited amounts of memory and cannot execute applications that require more memory\n",
    "than the available memory. The goal of the system is to maximize the total utilization of the memory of a given\n",
    "device. A foreground/background application pair is considered to be optimal if there does not exist another pair\n",
    "that uses more memory than this pair, and also has a total less than or equal to the total memory of the device. For\n",
    "example, if the device has 10MB memory, a foreground/background pair using a sum total of 9MB memory would be\n",
    "optimal if there does not exist a pair that uses a sum total of 10 MB, but would not be optimal if such a pair did\n",
    "exist.\n",
    "Write an algorithm to help James find the sets of foreground and background application pairs that optimally utilize\n",
    "the given device for a given list of foreground applications and a given list of background applications.\n",
    "Input\n",
    "The input to the function/method consists of three arguments:\n",
    "deviceCapacity, an integer representing the maximum capacity of the given device;\n",
    "foregroundAppList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique ID of a foreground\n",
    "application and the second integer represents the amount of memory required by this application;\n",
    "backgroundAppList, a list of pairs of integers where the first integer represents the unique ID of a background\n",
    "application and the second integer represents the amount of memory required by this application.\n",
    "Output\n",
    "Return a list of pairs of integers representing the pairs of IDs of foreground and background applications that\n",
    "optimally utilize the given device. If no pair is possible, return an empty list.\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "deviceCapacity = 7\n",
    "foregroundAppList = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,6]]\n",
    "backgroundAppList = [[1,2]]\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[[2,1]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are only three combinations, [1,1], [2,1], and [3,1], which use a total of 4, 6, and 8 MB memory, respectively.\n",
    "Since 6 is the largest use that does not exceed 7, [2,1] is the only optimal pair.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "deviceCapacity = 10\n",
    "foregroundAppList = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7], [4, 10]]\n",
    "backgroundAppList = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "[[2, 4], [3, 2]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "There are two pairs of foreground and background applications possible that optimally utilizes the given device.\n",
    "Application 2 from foregroundAppList uses 5 memory units, and application 4 from backgroundAppList also uses 5\n",
    "memory units. Combined, they add up to 10 units of memory.\n",
    "Similarly, application 3 from foregroundAppList uses 7 memory units, and application 2 from backgroundAppList\n",
    "uses 3 memory units. These also add up to 10 units of memory.\n",
    "Therefore, the pairs of foreground and background applications that optimally utilize the device are [2, 4] and [3, 2].\n",
